#Shift-Click Introduction to Coding Project

This project is the culmination of the 12 week introduction to programming course. Web technologies learnt during this time included HTML, CSS, and JS. This is a carousel built using those technologies.

The completion of this project is a pre-requisite to the Shift-Click Full Stack Web Development course and my aspiration is to become a Full Stack Web developer on the completion of the following course.
